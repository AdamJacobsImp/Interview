//Thinking problem:

//In your database, you have a list of users. 
//Each user can follow other users.
//How would you design a database schema to represent this relationship?

//How would you scale such a database?


//Write a function (query or code) to find the top 10 users whose followers have the most followers. 
//Eg. If Adam has 10 followers and each of Adam's followers has 100 followers, then Adam has a score of 1,000.
